  description: PReP is a webapp owned and developed by PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) that aims to aid the U.S. tax
    partners in filing their own tax returns. It's basically a large form system that can handle complex relationships
    (including many-to-one and many-to-many) between fields. The PReP iOS app allows users to take a photo of tax-related
    items such as a W-2 or even a physical object (e.g. a couch) that was purchased by the user. These photos can then be
    uploaded and associated with a particular field in the form, acting as a reference for where the data in that field came
    from - something especially useful in the case of an audit.

  description: This app aims to make the task of taking attendance at events hosted by individuals and 
    organizations much easier. To do this, I allow users to create a events with a specified location and
    time. Other users can check-in to these events only if they are within a specified radius from the 
    event location and if they are within the time frame of the event (start and end time). A list of
    attendees who were verified will automatically be pushed to the host's device. This app can eliminate 
    the need for using Google Docs, iClickers, or email, all very cumbersome means to (sometimes fraudulently)
     verify attendance.

  description: Designed and am currently building a guidance system for the Longhorn Rocket Associationâ€™s 2016
    competition rocket. This system uses an Arduino, an Adafruit 10 DOF IMU breakout board, and 4 digital servos
    to control variable pitch fins on the body of the rocket in order to keep a straight ascent to 10,000 ft. 
    This project involves collaboration between students in the Computer Science and Aerospace Engineering departments.

  description: Understanding the nature and relationship of every object and being throughout the Harry
    Potter landscape can be a monstrous task to tackle. There is a vast array of characters, spells,
    potions, and wands. Marauder's Map aims to simplify this data-overload problem by explicitly
    defining nearly every aspect of Harry Potter in a more easily navigable, dynamic manner. Every
    creature and object is clearly defined in a concise way that allows the user to easily navigate
    from model to model (defined in Django), portraying not only details about that model but also the
    relationships it holds with the rest of the Harry Potter world.
