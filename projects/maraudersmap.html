		<h3>Description</h2>
		<p>Understanding the nature and relationship of every object and being throughout the Harry
Potter landscape can be a monstrous task to tackle. There is a vast array of characters, spells,
potions, and wands. Marauder's Map aims to simplify this dataÂ­overload problem by explicitly
defining nearly every aspect of Harry Potter in a more easily navigable, dynamic manner. Every
creature and object is clearly defined in a concise way that allows the user to easily navigate
from model to model (defined in Django), portraying not only details about that model but also the
relationships it holds with the rest of the Harry Potter world.</p>
