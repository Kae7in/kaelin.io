		<h3>Description</h2>
		<p>Implemented a prediction algorithm, using millions of data points from past user ratings and other data from Netflix's movie database, to predict the ratings of movies that users had not yet watched. This was a reimplementation of a similar algorithm that won the Netflix Prize, which was an "open competition for the best collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films, based on previous ratings without any other information about the users or films, i.e. without the users or the films being identified except by numbers assigned for the contest."</p>
